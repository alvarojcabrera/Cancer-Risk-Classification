# üî¨ Cancer Risk Classification Using Machine Learning (Barranquilla, Colombia)

## üìå Overview

This project develops and evaluates Machine Learning models to classify the type of cancer (breast cancer or cervical cancer) based on sociodemographic and clinical variables.  
The study focuses on patients over 18 years old in Barranquilla, Colombia, and aims to support early diagnosis and improve decision-making in the public health sector.

The work was conducted as part of the **Master‚Äôs Thesis in Data Science** at Universidad Icesi.

## ü§ñ Results

| Cancer Type | Best Model | Key Metric |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Cervical Cancer | **XGBoost** | Highest precision and interpretability. |
| Breast Cancer | **MLP Neural Network** | Highest Recall and F1-Score. |

**Key Findings:**  
- Sociodemographic variables (age, locality, occupation) and clinical data were significant predictors.  
- XGBoost handled class imbalance effectively for cervical cancer.  
- MLP Neural Network captured complex patterns for breast cancer classification.
